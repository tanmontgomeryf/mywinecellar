                        Weâ€™ve come a long way since the era of the cellar book,

                        tomes and tracked by little tags hanging from their
                        necks. The wine world is actively embracing technology,
                        and home enthusiasts can get in on the action as well,
                        using this website to help keep their stash tabulated
                        and organized.
