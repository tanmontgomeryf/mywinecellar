My priority is just to finish this on time and with the required functionality. I wanted to do all the required functionality but I can't due to time restraint. Regarding about the architectural considerations, I was taught to separate like MVC setup. however I also just follow things from different tutorial. Especially if it gets the job done quicker. If I have some more time I would definitely clean my code and add more functionaliyu.

The only code that i didn't write is the Loading component, I got it from codepen. (sorry I forgot to get the name).
